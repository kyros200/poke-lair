*Disclaimer: This is a project for applying for a new job*

### Context
PokeLair is supposed to be a ***shady*** store where the Galarians (*People from the Galar region, where the games Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield are based on. It's famous for not having a lot of Pokémon from the National Dex*) rely on having a new way to have Pokémon from the other regions (Kanto, Johto, Sinnoh, Alola, ...).

So, as a user, you can shop on PokeLair to choose between all Pokémon from all other regions (*until #809 on National Dex*) and form the best team you ever dreamed, as long as you can afford of course.

***Avaiable in Galarian and English only***
